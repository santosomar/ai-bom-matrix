# Interactive SPDX AI Bill of Materials (BOM) Explainer

This is an interactive, single-page web application designed to explain the key concepts and properties of the SPDX 3.0 AI Profile. The tool provides a user-friendly interface to explore the components of an AI Bill of Materials (BOM) through a dynamic, force-directed graph and a detailed matrix.

This project was created by [Omar Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santosomar/).

## Features

- **Interactive Force-Directed Graph:** A dynamic visualization built with D3.js that shows the relationships between the core AI System, its categories, and specific SPDX terms.
- **Dynamic & Responsive:** Nodes in the graph can be clicked and dragged, with the physics-based simulation adjusting the layout in real-time.
- **Detailed Matrix:** A comprehensive table that lists and explains key terms from the SPDX 3.0 AI Profile, including their core concepts, purpose, and examples.
- **Click-to-Highlight:** Clicking on a term in the visualization graph automatically scrolls to and highlights the corresponding row in the matrix for easy reference.
- **Modern UI:** A clean and responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **D3.js** for the interactive data visualization.

## How to Use

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No server or build process is required.

## About the SPDX 3.0 AI Profile

An AI Bill of Materials (BOM) is a detailed inventory of all the components that make up an artificial intelligence system. The SPDX 3.0 AI Profile provides a standardized way to create these BOMs, fostering greater transparency, security, and responsible AI development.

This tool serves as an educational resource to help developers, security professionals, and compliance officers understand these important concepts.
